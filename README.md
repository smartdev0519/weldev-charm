Charm
=====

Charm is a set of tools that makes adding a backend to your terminal-based
applications fun and easy. Quickly build modern CLI applications without
worrying about user accounts, data storage and encryption.

Charm powers terminal apps like [Glow][glow] and [Skate][skate].

## Features

* [**Charm KV:**](#charm-kv) an embeddable, encrypted, cloud-synced key-value store built on [BadgerDB][badger]
* [**Charm FS:**](#charm-fs) a Go `fs.FS` compatible cloud-based user filesystem
* [**Charm Crypt:**](##charm-crypt) end-to-end encryption for stored data and on-demand encryption for arbitrary data
* [**Charm Accounts:**](#charm-accounts) invisible user account creation and authentication
* [**Charm Client:**](#charm-client) the powerful client for directly accessing all Charm services
* [**Self Hosting:**](#self-hosting) anyone can self-host their own Charm Cloud with `charm serve`

## Charm KV

A powerful embeddable key-value store built on [BadgerDB][badger]. Store user
data, configuration, create a cache or even store large files as values.

When you use Charm KV, your users get cloud backup, the ability to self-host,
multi-machine syncing, and encryption for free.

Charm KV can also enhance existing [BadgerDB][badger] implementations. It works
with standard Badger transactions and provides top level functions that mirror
those in Badger.

For details on Charm KV, see [the Charm KV docs][kv].

```go
import "github.com/charmbracelet/charm/kv"

// Open a database (or create one if it doesn‚Äôt exist)
db, err := kv.OpenWithDefaults("my-cute-db")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer db.Close()

// Fetch updates and easily define your own syncing strategy
if err := db.Sync(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Save some data
if err := db.Set([]byte("fave-food"), []byte("gherkin")); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// All data is binary
if err := db.Set([]byte("profile-pic"), someJPEG); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

## Charm FS

Each Charm user has a virtual personal filesystem on the Charm server.  Charm
FS provides a Go [fs.FS](https://golang.org/pkg/io/fs/) implementation for the
user along with additional write and delete methods. If you're a building
a tool that requires file storage, Charm FS will provide it on
a networked-basis without friction-filled authentication flows.

For more on Charm FS see [the Charm FS docs][fs].

```go
import charmfs "github.com/charmbracelet/charm/fs"

// Open the user‚Äôs filesystem
cfs, err := charmfs.NewFS()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Save a file
data := bytes.NewBuffer([]byte("some data"))
if err := cfs.WriteFile("./path/to/file", data, fs.FileMode(0644)); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Get a file
f, err := cfs.Open("./path/to/file")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer f.Close()

// Just read whole file in one shot
data, err := cfs.ReadFile("./path/to/file")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

## Charm Crypt

All data sent to a Charm server is fully encrypted on the client. Charm Crypt
provides methods for easily encrypting and decrypting data for a Charm user.
All key management and account linking is handled seamlessly by Charm.

For more on Charm Crypt see [the Charm Crypt docs][crypt].

## Charm Accounts

The best part of Charm accounts is that both you and your users don‚Äôt need to
think about them. Charm authentication is based on SSH keys, so account
creation and authentication is built into all Charm tools and is invisible and
frictionless.

If a user already has Charm keys, we authenticate with them. If not, we create
new ones. Users can also easily link multiple machines to their account, and
linked machines will seamlessly gain access to their owners Charm data. Of
course, users can revoke machines‚Äô access too.


## Charm Client

The `charm` binary also includes easy access to a lot of the functionality
available in the libraries. This could be useful in scripts, as a standalone
utility or when testing functionality.

```bash
# Link a machine to your Charm account
charm link

# Set a value
charm kv set weather humid

# Print out a tree of your files
charm fs tree /

# Encrypt something
charm encrypt < secretphoto.jpg > encrypted.jpg.json

# For more info
charm help
```

## Self Hosting

Charm libraries point at our Charmbracelet, Inc. servers by default (that‚Äôs
api.charm.sh), however it's very simple for users to host their own Charm
instances. The `charm` binary is a single, statically-linked executable capable
of serving an entire Charm instance:

```bash
charm serve
```

You can also use the Docker image, which has the benefit of putting the server
behind HTTPS:

```bash
docker pull charm:latest
docker run charm
```

To change hosts users can set `CHARM_HOST` to the domain or IP or their
choosing:

```bash
export CHARM_HOST=burrito.example.com
```
